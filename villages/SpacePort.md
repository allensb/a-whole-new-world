# The Village of Space Port

Space Port is a striving port on the Atlantian Ocean. The villagers strive to work 80 hours a week, doing what they 
love. Trying to reach the Final Frontier! They strive for economic growth in order to reach their goal! 

## Production

Space Port is a modern village which is able to constantly generate a surplus from their advancements to 
technology and is willing to offer trade for this surplus to any neighbor in need. 

The primary product of Space Port will hopefully be asteroid mining, satelite and gps communications, and expensive 
joy rides to space.

## Lifestyle

Space Port lifestyle is busy and fast. 
We often visit Elon library to learn the latest and greatest about Rockets and apply that knowledge to our 
goal of reaching the vast unknown. 

## Architecture

Buildings in Space Port follow a modern style with houses made from beautful materials produced from Cormyr.
